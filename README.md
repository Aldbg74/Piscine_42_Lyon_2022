<h1> Piscine 42_Lyon_2022 </h1>
Exo from the swimming pool of Lyon. Do not copy friends, cheating is not good (and I was not selected)
Compliation of the projects I did during my swimming pool.
Cheating is not cool and it's not good, you won't learn and you'll crash on the exam so don't copy!
I put my exos here so I can keep track of them.

<h1> What is 42 ? </h1>
42 is a free code school, created by Xaviel Niel, the founder of free, and Nicolas Sadirac. It is open 24/7. There is no teacher, the school relies on the principle of project-based learning using peer-learning. (You don't know the answer, you ask google or your mate)

The swimming pool is the name of the selection events. For the Lyon campus, at the time of this writing there are 3 admission periods, one in July, August and September.
Each swimming pool lasts 1 month during which you will have to prove yourself, and show that the school's pedagogy is adapted to your way of learning.
